/*

And therefore, in React, you instead add event listeners to elements by adding a special attribute, a special prop to those elements.

And I'm calling it a prop here as well, because in the end those built-in elements are also just components.

And the special prop you want to add here is the onClick prop. And these built-in elements support many on-something props.

Now the value for this onClick prop here, or actually for any event prop, is a function. So the value you should provide here should be a function because you want to point at the function that should be executed when that event here occurs.

When the button is clicked, by React, under the hood, and therefore we just use the function name here, we use the function as a value, therefore, and we pass that function as a value to onClick.
