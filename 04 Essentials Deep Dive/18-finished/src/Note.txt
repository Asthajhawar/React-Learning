So that's how we could update

the player's data.

And now, we just need to make sure

that handlePlayerNameChange gets triggered

whenever in the player component.

This change is confirmed

by clicking this button when it says Save.

So, as a first step,

we can pass a pointer

at this handlePlayerNameChange function

to those Player components, for example,

through a prop that we could name onChangeName,

and we need to do this for both players, of course.

And inside of this player component, should be,

should, therefore, destructure this onChangeName prop

and accept it here.

And then here in this handleEditClick function

which is triggered whenever the Edit button is clicked,

we can call onChangeName

and then pass the symbol as a first argument.

Because in handlePlayerNameChange,

we expect the symbol as a first parameter

and then the new name as a second parameter.

And, therefore, in the player component,

the second argument we pass to onChangeName

is that player name,

that's currently stored here

in this playerName state.

Now, this, of course, also means

that this function here will be triggered

if we start editing,

and therefore here we could add a,

if check and check if isEditing is true,

we only call onChangeName, if that is the case.

Because if isEditing is true, that means

that we just click the button to stop editing

and, therefore, we wanna trigger this function.

Now, with that, in the app component up here,

we can now use this players' state

to show the correct player name

when the game is over.

So, here, we can go down to our winner logic,

and, here, instead of setting winner

equal to the symbol of the player who won,

we can use this players' state here

to derive the name of the player,

who won by dynamically accessing a property.

And the property we want to access

is stored in firstSquareSymbol

because that's either an X or an O.

And these are exactly the two properties we have here.

And that again,

is some standard JavaScript syntax

for dynamically accessing a property

where the property name

is not hard coded

but stored in some variable or constant.

And with that all out of the way,

if we save this and reload,

we should be able to win

and see the name of the player who won.

And, of course, if I restart

and I change that name

and I now win

like this, I see Max won.

And with that, we finally finished this game

and we got all the functionality in there,

that we need, to play this game.
